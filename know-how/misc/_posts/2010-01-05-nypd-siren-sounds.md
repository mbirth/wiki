A nice collection of all available siren sounds in a NYPD police car can be found at the [NY Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/14/nyregion/15siren_sounds.html).
The *"Air Horn"* sound going through a [horn loudspeaker](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horn_loudspeaker) should give
the typical horn sound of ambulances.
