Instead of playing music through usual audio players, there is the possibility of using the *mpd* - a daemon which
runs in the background and plays music.

The great advantage is: You can choose between various interfaces and always control the same player with the same
playlist(s) - even via TCP/IP from another PC or even a portable device.


Installing the server
=====================

Install the package [mpd](apt://mpd). After that, edit the file `/etc/mpd.conf` and add the following lines, so that it
uses the PulseAudio daemon instead of ALSA:

~~~
audio_output {
    type "pulse"
    name "My PulseAudio Device"
}
~~~

This allows other sounds (e.g. from Gnome) to be played simultaneously.

You can then symlink your personal music folder to `/var/lib/mpd/music` or - if you are the only user - replace that
directory by the symlink directly.


PulseAudio rights
-----------------

You might encounter the problem that MPD seems playing a song but you don't hear anything at all. This might be a
problem with PulseAudio rights. Install the package [paprefs](apt://paprefs) and enable the *Enable Network Access*
and *Don't require authentication*. If these options are grayed out, do this:

* edit the file `/etc/pulse/default.pa`
* find the line  
  
        #load-module module-native-protocol-tcp

  and replace it by  
  
        load-module module-native-protocol-tcp auth-anonymous=1
* do a `killall pulseaudio`
* restart `mpd`


Installing a client
===================

I found [pympd](http://pympd.sf.net/), [Ario](http://ario-player.sf.net/) and [Sonata](http://sonata.berlios.de/) really
usable (pympd looks a bit like *Rhythmbox*) and for the console: [ncmpc](http://hem.bredband.net/kaw/ncmpc/). For the
latter, you could add an alias: `ncmpc=ncmpc -c -m` to always start it in color-mode and with mouse support.
