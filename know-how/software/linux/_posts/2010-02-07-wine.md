Java crashes with EXCEPTION_ACCESS_VIOLATION (0xc00000005)
==========================================================

The [AirVideo](http://www.inmethod.com/) Server for iPhone runs only under Mac and Windows and needs [Bonjour](http://support.apple.com/downloads/Bonjour_for_Windows)
and [JRE](http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp). Java always crashed with

    EXCEPTION_ACCESS_VIOLATION (0xc0000005) at pc=0x7d826f48, pid=8, tid=12

After some poking around, I found a thread at [nabble.com](http://old.nabble.com/Wine%2BJava%2BNvidia-crashes-td22505117.html).
Disabling the `d3d9.dll` was the solution:

1. Run `winecfg`
1. Go to the *Libraries* tab
1. Select `d3d9` from the drop-down box, click *Add*
1. Select the new entry `d3d9` and click *Editâ€¦*
1. Select *(X) disabled*, click *OK*

That was it. Now, Java should run smoothly.
