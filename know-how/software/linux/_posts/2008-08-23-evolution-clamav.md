To scan incoming mails for viruses, create to following script somewhere in your system:

{% highlight bash %}

FILE=/tmp/$$_outclam.tmp
clamdscan - 1>$FILE

if [ $? -eq 1 ]; then
STRING=$(grep "FOUND" $FILE |cut -d: -f2)
zenity --warning --title="Evolution: Virus detected" --text="$STRING" &

exit 1
fi

exit 0
{% endhighlight %}

Now setup Evolution's Incoming mail filters to pipe mails through your newly created script. If the return value is not
zero, a virus was detected and you might want to move the mail to *Trash* or a special folder.
