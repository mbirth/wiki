> Fellow universal users who suffer from battery problems, i know this issue is reccuring and is in many threads and

> Attached is a pic of the universal battery and below is a little procedure that you might wanna try.
>
> Lets say your universal battery is dying after 10 mins and you just had charged it overnight (meter says it died at
> 95% or whatever.. ) here is what you do.
>
> 1. take the battery out locate the pin provided in this pic attached. its the second pin from the top if you are
>    holding the battery with the connector being to the upper right corner (just see the pic)
> 1. cover this pin with a thin peice of tape that you will leave temporarily. till the battery fully dies.
> 1. turn your universal on after placing the battery in it again
> 1. change the power settings in a way that leaves the universal on for all the time unless you manually turn it off..
>    so all the power savings are off.
> 1. let your battery drain all the way until it just turns the universal off.
> 1. take the battery out and remove the insulation from that pin
> 1. turn your universal on again and let it charge overnight or till the light turns green.
> 1. this fixed my universals' battery and now mine turns off at 5%
>
> p.s. while the universal is running and the pin is insulated you will notice that the battery indicator that shows
> the percentage left doesn't work. (thats the whole point making the ppc blind and not being able to read how much is
> in the batter and take full advantage of whats in it as far as power goes, this will make the battery realize that it
> was drained more than usual and forces it to recalculate or recalibrate itself.
>
> by the way you will also notice that the universal wont be able to get charged while that pin is insulated. so again
> my advice is fully charge your battery , take it out, insulate the pin then drain it all the way, take the insulation
> out and recharge until light is green.
>
> please post if you had a successful result and hopefully for all who are suffering from this battery problem now they
> have one more
