*Rooting* means installing a `su` binary onto the device, which provides a way to become the `root` (=Superuser, "su")
user on the Android system. `root` has access to everything and thus you can do really nasty things with it.


Preparation
===========

Unlock bootloader
-----------------

If not already done, unlock your bootloader.


su binary
---------

There are currently two different "su" binaries available: [Superuser](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.noshufou.android.su)
and [SuperSU](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=eu.chainfire.supersu). I prefer the latter one.

These apps are only for updating an already installed binary, so you'll need the installable zip file for your desired binary:

* [SuperSU](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1538053)
* [Superuser](http://androidsu.com/superuser/) (get the *Superuser-â€¦* zip which includes the updater app)


Recovery
--------

The stock recovery only allows flashing zip files from a special directory you can't access yet. So you'll need a
custom recovery to work around this limitation.

There are - again - 2 options: ClockworkMod (CWM) Recovery or TeamWin Recovery Project (TWRP). I prefer the latter one.

* [ClockworkMod Recovery](http://www.clockworkmod.com/rommanager) (download "touch" or "non-touch" version)
* [TeamWin Recovery Project](http://teamw.in/twrp_view_all_devices) (download the recovery image, **not** the app install method)
