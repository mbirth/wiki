Hide Trayicon
=============

To save space in the systray, you can run opera with the `-notrayicon` parameter.

    opera -notrayicon


Disable Mailsystem
==================

To save some memory footprint, you can disable the mail module in Opera.

    opera -nomail


Cleanup caches
==============

Opera accumulates several Megabytes on caches, esp. those, who don't cleanup themselves such as the favicon cache. Use
this little script to clean up files which haven't been read in the past 14 days from the 3 dirs: `cache4`, `images`
and `opcache`:

{% highlight bash %}
#!/bin/bash

OPERADIR=~/.opera
OPERACLEANDIRS="cache4 images opcache"

for OPERACDIR in $OPERACLEANDIRS; do
    DIR=$OPERADIR/$OPERACDIR
    echo $DIR
    find $DIR -atime +14 -exec rm {} \;
done
{% endhighlight %}
