Install Fujitsu-Siemens version
===============================

If you want to install a *Microsoft Office* and you happen to only have an OEM version from Fujitsu-Siemens, you'll
notice that it refuses to install on any Non-FSC-PC. But after some peeking around on the CD, you'll find a
suspiciously large file `Install\OFF_FSC.EXE` with around 250 MiB.

Taking a look at it reveals something strange:

This doesn't look like a normal `EXE` file, it's missing the typical `MZ` header. Also the following data looks
encrypted, i.e. somewhat random.

Somewhat below you'll find some strings which have to do with unpacking - so the file seems to be a crypted
self-extracting archive.

Going several pages further down, you'll find something familiar:

`MSCF` stands for *MicroSoft Cabinet File*. It's a header for the standard `CAB` archives used to distribute software.
The `AUTORUN.INF`, `CC561401.CAB`, etc. are also a clear sign that this seems to be the index of the archive. The
letters `MSCF` are mentioned several times before this location but there was no file index near them. This one here is
clearly a standard CAB file.

So now take your favorite Hex-Editor and cut everything up to the `MSCF` header. The new file has to begin with `MSCF`.
Rename it to something `.cab` and use your favorite archiving tool to unpack it. Et voilà!
