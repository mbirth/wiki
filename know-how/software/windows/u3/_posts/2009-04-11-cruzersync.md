For the SanDisk cruzer Titanium U3, there is a sync-software called *CruzerSync* which really is an OEM version of *DMailer*.

In the *SanDisk U3 Download Central* you'll find a link to [CruzerSync 6.2.042.1](http://u3.sandisk.com/download/apps/CruzerSync.u3p)
which is ancient. <del>Then I somehow found a link directly at `DMailer.com`, which serves [CruzerSync 6.3.130.0](http://www.dmailer.com/CruzerSync.u3p)
(which updates itself to 6.3.134.0 after startup).</del>

Using their [old versions list](http://www.dmailer.com/web/index.php/support/anciennesVersions)
(where there is [CruzerSync 6.3.136.0](http://www.dmailer.org/download/old_release/u3/CruzerSyncV6.u3p.zip)), I found
out that they store their files in the form `CruzerSyncV6.u3p.zip` on the server. So I tried the filename
`CruzerSyncV7.u3p.zip` and finally omitted the `V7` - and there it was in the download folder:
[CruzerSync 7.0.142.0](http://www.dmailer.org/download/CruzerSync.u3p.zip) for U3. (To enable the new black skin, you
have to delete your sync profile inside CruzerSync.)

btw: There's also [CruzerSync 7.0.138.0](http://www.dmailer.org/download/CruzerSync.zip) for non-U3-sticks.

The last two links are generic links which should always return the latest version of CruzerSync.
