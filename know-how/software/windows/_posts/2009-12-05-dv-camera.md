If you can't aquire any video from a DV camera connected via Firewire/IEEE1394, check if you have these symptoms:

* *Windows Live Movie Maker* says "The device is already in use."
* other programs (e.g. *NeroVision*) show a black box but let you control the camera

The reason seems to be a faulty IEEE1394 driver in *Windows 7* 64-bit. Check the *Device Manager* whether you have the
*Texas Instruments 1394 Controller* installed. If so, right-click and choose *Update driverâ€¦*, search your computer for
drivers, install manually from a list and select the **OHCI-compliant 1394 Host controller (Legacy)** driver.

After it is installed, you should be able to capture video again.
