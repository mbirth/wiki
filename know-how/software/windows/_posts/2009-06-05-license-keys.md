At [My Digital Life](http://www.mydigitallife.info/2007/04/24/search-for-genuine-and-free-windows-product-keys-online-with-google/)
you can read about [Belarc Advisor](http://www.belarc.com/free_download.html) spreading Windows license keys. Advisor
is a system profiler which also includes the Windows key in its reports. Users posting them to the Internet also
publish their Windows key. A common string of Advisor reports is "*Belarc Advisor Current Profile*". Together with the
desired Windows version you can easily find license keys:
