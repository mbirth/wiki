To manually update the firmware, put the new firmware named as `update.zip` onto the root directory of the microSD card.
Then do this: (found at [androidspin.com](http://forum.androidspin.com/showthread.php?t=2631))

1. power off the phone
1. hold down the trackball and press the Power button.
1. you'll get a white screen with three Android robots on skateboards → select *Bootloader*
1. now select *Recovery*
1. the phone will reboot showing a robot and a warning sign
1. now press Power and Volume up together (if it doesn't work the first time, try again)
1. now choose *Apply sdcard:update.zip* (use trackball!)
1. wait for it to finish
1. choose *Reboot now*
