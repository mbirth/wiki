To add custom sounds to your Android phone, create the following folders on your SD-card:

    /sdcard/media/audio/ringtones
    /sdcard/media/audio/alarms
    /sdcard/media/audio/notifications

Now you can put your MP3 sound files into these folders and they will appear upon the tone selection
dialogs. (You may have to wait a while until they appear, maybe even have to reboot the phone.)

On older Android phones, you might have to create the folders `ringtones`, `alarms` and `notifications` in the root
of your SD card. (see [here](http://www.androidforums.com/t-mobile-g1/1757-can-you-set-music-youve-uploaded-ringtone-texts.html))
