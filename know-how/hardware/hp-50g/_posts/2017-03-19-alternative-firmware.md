The original firmware in the HP 50g emulates a [Saturn CPU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HP_Saturn)
like the HP 48 and HP 49 had. However, the built-in [ARM920T](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM9#ARM920T)
processor has more power than the Saturn.

And now there's a firmware to unleash the power: **newRPL**

[Project homepage](http://hpgcc3.org/projects/newrpl)

It's very usable at this point, but not all features are implemented yet. You can see the current
status on the [detailed project status page](http://hpgcc3.org/projects/newrpl/project-status/detailed-status).
