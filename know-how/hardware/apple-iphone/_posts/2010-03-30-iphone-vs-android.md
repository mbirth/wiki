|                 iPhone                    |                     Android (esp. Nexus One)                  |
|:------------------------------------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------|
| It's from *Apple*.                        | It's **NOT** from *Apple*. (or: It's from *Google*.)  |
| can change keyboard layout on the fly     | keyboard language related to GUI language (not independently configurable!), but different input methods (not only keyboards) downloadable/switchable on the fly  |
| ~150.000 Apps (most are gimmicks though)  | ~30.000 Apps and growing, some well-known web-based services still missing as a native App  |
| Apple decides which apps get onto the phone/in the AppStore  | very loose controlled Market store<br />can install apps via USB or web download, even from Linux  |
| only syncs with one single *iTunes*, i.e. no Linux support at all, no sync at multiple places  | supports USB HDD mode where you can use the microSD-card like a flash disk  |
| can sync with local software (e.g. Outlook) via iTunes  | syncs mostly with Google services or Exchange, but custom apps available for ActiveSync, SyncML, Outlook, etc.  |
| supports Push Notifications via Apple servers  | Push Notifications are a bit complicated and not native (e.g. IBM MQTT) **but** can use Jabber/XMPP messages via *Google Talk* for notifications  |
| Tethering depends on network carrier / paid  | Tethering via different methods from free to $30  |
| cheap iPhone OS upgrades in the future (OS2 â†’ OS3 for iPod Touch was $9.95), new versions still support (almost) all old devices  | Android updates depend on cell phone maker  |
| Apple forbids downgrades of software, even from 3.1.3 to 3.1.2 is not possible --- even when they have broken a feature  | You even get the [instructions](http://developer.htc.com/adp.html) from them...  |
| you are limited to those service providers *Apple* cooperates with ("exclusive contracts")  | open for all network service providers  |
| can't replace/change battery              | spare batteries are available  |
| Apple's sense of *security* is not the best: [h-online.com](http://www.h-online.com/security/news/item/Mac-OS-X-safer-but-less-secure-957981.html)  | |
| [iPhone's Headset](http://www.howtomobile.com/apple-iphone/how-to-use-the-iphone-stereo-headset/) has only 1 button (push once to Play/Pause; push twice to Skip Track)  | [Android Headset](http://www.google.com/support/android/bin/static.py?page=guide.cs&guide=27201&topic=27212&answer=168441#1084954) has 3 buttons (Last Track; Play/Pause; Next Track)  |
| only one App can be used at a time        | Multitasking!  |
| Apps are limited to their own files (+Pictures/Camera), i.e. you can't access file stored with a different App  | Apps have access to all files in your Home directory, i.e. Images, Music, etc.  |
| somewhat sloppy (3G)                      | blazing fast  |
| can only have App icons on the Home screen, nothing else is configurable<br />up to 11 pages with 110 Apps (more can be run by searching)  | Home screen can have Widgets, Icons, Subfolders (for more Icons) and you can change the wallpaper (even to an animated "Live Wallpaper")<br />5 pages, but folders allow for more Apps; also "All Apps at once" view integrated; searching is also available  |
| syncs fine with Exchange                  | doesn't sync Exchange calendars  |
| have to check Inboxes of each mail acct   | Unified inbox available  |
