(Found [here](http://www.gizmodo.com.au/2008/12/flash_for_iphone_comes_via_jailbroken_imobilecinema_app-2.html).)

You need to have a [jailbroken]({% post_url 2009-06-20-jailbreak %}) iPhone for this.

Add the repository `http://d.imobilecinema.com/` to Cydia and find the **iMobileCinema**. After installing it, you should be able to watch Flash movies in Safari (most of the times).
