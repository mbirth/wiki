* **Homepage:** [appulo.us](http://appulo.us/appdb/)

Appulous is a **special** AppStore for [jailbroken]({% post_url 2009-06-20-jailbreak %}) iPhones. The problem of the
original AppStore is that you can't test the applications. You are mostly dependent on the reviews - if there are some.

Appulous lets you test drive most applications from the AppStore.

To install it, add the following source to *Cydia*: `http://cydia.hackulo.us` . Then install the **Installous** package
using Cydia.

*(If you decide to keep an application, buy it from the original AppStore. The developer deserves it.)*

<p><div class="noteclassic" markdown="1">
Apps installed via Installous are mostly wiped upon a sync with iTunes. To fix this, buy them.[^1]
