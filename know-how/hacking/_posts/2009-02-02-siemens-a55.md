A friend visited me bringing two A55 with SIMlock. Both were from the same provider and both didn't accept the
unlocking code from the provider for some reason. After trying the usual tools without luck, we used the [testpoint method](http://www.allsiemens.com/testpoints/siemens-A55.htm).
Using very sharp tweezers, we scratched away the protective from the desired trace and cut it. Now we were able to use
*Freia* without any problems. (set to "Bootcore Bug")
