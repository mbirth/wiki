A M65 of my in-laws seemed broken so I took it home to play around with my `DCA-510`-cable.

It showed firmware rev. 15 … the current one was rev. 58. I read somewhere that older firmware WILL produce problems so
I was glad that it might be a software problem instead of a hardware one.


Upgrading firmware
==================

So I got the latest firmware from [allsiemens.com](http://www.allsiemens.com/flash/M65.htm) and tried to flash the
phone. Damn! The M65 was from Vodafone and thus the ID was `M6V` instead of `M65`. Since I hate brandings, I needed a
way to change that value.

After some experiments I found instructions at [gsm-multifund.de](http://www.gsm-multifund.de/board/showthread.php?t=8864)
(which seems to be offline now).

I needed *[x65flasher](http://www.allsiemens.com/soft/flashers-1.htm)* and since I updated the phone to [M6V v50](http://www.allsiemens.com/flash/M6V.htm)
before, I needed the supplied Java-Midlet `px75v1` to calculate the Hash and ESN for my phone. This needed around 3-5
minutes. After that, I was able to download a backup of the phone's firmware and then chose *Advanced* → *Change phone
model* to change it to `M65`. After writing it back to the phone, I did a *FFSinit* (see allsiemens.com) and was
finally able to flash the rev. 58 using *WinSwup*.

Also a nice page with many tips and instructions: [gsm-free.com](http://www.gsm-free.com/index.htm).


Patching the firmware
=====================

You can use [Smelter](http://www.allsiemens.com/soft/flashers-1.htm) to generate a list with possible patches for the
supplied firmware file which you can then apply using [V_KLay](http://www.allsiemens.com/soft/flashers-2.htm). There
are patches to e.g. disable some debugging (which makes the phone a bit faster) or enable the network monitor
(aka. *Develop. setup*) in the "My Menu".


Internal Filesystem
===================

If you want to get rid of the "Load games", "Load Ringtones", etc. menus, just use the [VSOFS-Plugin](http://www.totalcmd.net/plugring/vsofs.html)
for [Total Commander](http://www.ghisler.com/) to delete the file `\\M65\Config\Default\MagicLinks\MagicLinks.xml` and
the directory on the phone.
