I got a Samsung ZM-60 from T-Mobile (incl. SIMlock). The first shock came after switching it on for the first time:
Everything was in the T-Mobile magenta color. After some research, I found out, that it's originally a `SGH-Z300`.


Firmware flashing
=================

Instructions on how to flash a new firmware are on [handy-faq.de](http://www.handy-faq.de/forum/showthread.php?t=13916).
There also was a nice collection of firmware images on [anvi.it](http://www.anvi.it/forum/index.php?showtopic=20637),
but seems to be down for now.

The best firmware seems to be the `Z300AIEK1`, since it is only slightly branded by *TIM* (an Italian provider?) and
contains everything the original Samsung-Firmwares do.

You can use the supplied cable to flash the phone.

1. run the *Downloader Z300-Z500*
1. find your desired firmware file
1. power off the phone, hold the <kbd>9</kbd> key and power it on so that the outer display shows "Download" on red
   background
1. initiate the transfer

The flashing takes about 12 minutes and after that, you have the original Z300 Samsung theme.


SIMlock
=======

To remove the SIMlock, there's a manual at [gsmhosting.com](http://forum.gsmhosting.com/vbb/showthread.php?t=239111).
You need the *Qualcomm Unlocker* and a PC with a `COM1:` port where you need to short the Pins #2 and #3. Then it's a
thing of 20 seconds to get rid of the SIMlock.


Downloading jar files
=====================

The phone accepts `.jar` files from any server if it sends the content type `application/java-archive` instead of
`application/octet-stream`. This is easily accomplished by adding a `.htaccess` file with the line

    AddType application/java-archive .jar

to the directory where the `.jar` files are on your server.


Phone identification
====================

The phone sends the following User-Agent to websites:

    SGH-Z300 SHP/VPP/R5 SMB3.1 SMM-MMS/1.2.0 profile/MIDP-2.0
