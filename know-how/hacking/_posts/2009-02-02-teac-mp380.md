A local discounter offered a MP4-player *[entryx EM850](http://www.entryx.de/deutsch/produkte/mp3player/2gb_mediaplayer_mp3.html)*
some time ago. The supplied firmware has some severe problems, e.g. the devices powers off while playing without touching it.

After some research, I found some thread at [discountfan.de](http://www.discountfan.de/forumneu/read.php?8,161599,162423)
which mentions that the device is originally built by [YIFANG](http://www.yifangdigital.com/Product/EM850.htm) and is
OEM'ed as [Meizu M6](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M6_Mini_Player) or [TEAC MP-380](http://www.teac-shop.de/product_info.php/info/p151_MP-380-2GB-Flash-MP3-Player.html).

The TEAC firmware is brand new and thus fixes the problems of the entryx version. Since you can't download the firmware
from the TEAC homepage, you have to get it from [rapidshare.com](http://rapidshare.com/files/49786276/TEM850RB_PCB1.4_002_1.7.17_new.rar.html).

All other files you can get directly from YIFANG: On the [download page](http://rapidshare.com/files/49786276/TEM850RB_PCB1.4_002_1.7.17_new.rar.html)
further down you'll find a [EM850RB driver package](http://www.yifangdigital.com/download/driver/audio/em850rb.rar)
which also contains the firmware-updater and drivers for the Rock-chip (both contained in the *ConsumerUpdate* inside
the RAR archive). You have to unpack the ConsumerUpdate and install it.

Now do the following:

1. unplug the MP4-player from your PC
1. hold the <kbd>M</kbd> key while plugging it in and hold the <kbd>M</kbd> key for some more seconds
    * the PC should show a new device and ask for drivers
1. choose manually selection of drivers and point it to the directory where you installed the ConsumerUpdate to
1. when the drivers are installed, run the `Consumer.exe` (for English language, change the `Consumer.ini` and set
   `UILanguage` to `ENG` instead of `CH_S`)
1. choose the firmware file (`.rfw`) and click on *Update*
1. 3 minutes later, everything should be done, exit the Updater
1. unplug the device and power it on
    * the upgrade should be launched

After the upgrade completed, you might have to format the internal storage for the player to recognize it.

Some little bonus: After the upgrade, you'll find a Tetris game as well as a FM-Tuner. But the latter one doesn't have
any reception - maybe they didn't add an antenna, although the IC would support it.
