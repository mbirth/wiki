RPC1
====

*RPC1* means removing the region code or region-switching lock from the drive. Normally the DVD drive is set to your
region (1..5) so that you can only play DVDs from your region. You can change this region 5 times with the last change
being permanently.

RPC1 means removing this limit. Also you can sometimes set your drive to region code **0** which will allow you to play
DVDs of any region.

You can enable *RPC1* by using [MCSE](http://forum.rpc1.org/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=41228&st=0&sk=t&sd=a&start=125).

<p><div class="noteclassic" markdown="1">
Windows XP will continue to show a *X changes left* in the region settings. But this is a software lock. Open *RegEdit*
and go to `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft`. There you'll find a key with strange characters (something like `';t-z%`)
which contains a single REG_QWORD value. Delete the whole key and you'll be back at *5 changes left*.
