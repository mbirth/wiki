I recently found some of my manuals to remove BIOS passwords in a very familiar design on a
[totally foreign site](http://www.pc-doctors.com/other/free-info/):

<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/ripoff-pcdoctors.png" alt="" width="600" />

This page is from 2006.


Now take a look at my old homepage:

<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/original-riddick.png" alt="" width="600" />

I have SVN logs going back till December 2004 where I have started working on these pages. Also all pages behind the
links are 1:1 copies of my contents - just with another background and text color.


Being confronted with the facts, *Roger Brehm* played dumb and said he got that info from one of his "techs", then he
tried to shit me about my photos being b&w and his being colored (a filter in my CSS which only kicked in if you were
surfing my site with Internet Explorer) and a missing copyright information on my pages. As if this would give him the
right to copy everything and publish it under his name.

Of course, he didn't even put a link to my site on his pages. Not even after I asked him to do so.

If anyone wants to pay him a "nice" visit ... [Google him](http://google.com/search?q="Roger+Brehm"+hampton)

**UPDATE:** Looks like those pages are offline for now. You can still catch a view from the
[Google Cache](http://google.com/search?q=cache%3Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.theonlypcdoctor.com%2Fother%2Ffree-info%2Findex.htm).
