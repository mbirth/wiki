I found three different ways for bypassing the password-check on a Toshiba-notebook. I had no chance to test them, so I
can't promise they will work.


Holding SHIFT
=============

Hold down the **left SHIFT-key** upon bootup - this should skip the password-check on most notebooks and on some
desktop-systems.


KeyDisk
=======

For this one, you will need an empty 3 1/2" disk (720KiB or 1.44MiB), another computer (to which you have full access)
and a good Disk-Editor (e.g. [Hex-Workshop](http://www.bpsoft.com/)).

This method should work on ALL Toshiba notebooks.

1. Bootup the other computer, install and launch the Diskeditor.
1. Insert the disk and open the **second sector** of the disk.
1. Change the **first five Bytes** of the second sector of the disk (the first sector is the boot sector) to: `4B 45 59 00 00`
1. Write the changes to the disk. Now you have a KeyDisk!
1. Remove the disk and insert it into the drive of the notebook computer.
1. Start the notebook in Boot Mode (push the reset button).
1. Press <kbd>ENTER</kbd> when asked for password.
1. You will be asked to set password again. Press <kbd>Y</kbd> and <kbd>ENTER</kbd>.
1. You should now see the BIOS configuration where you can set a new password.


Loopback-Connector
==================

This is a 25pin male connector which fits onto the printer port. You have to short-circuit the following pins:

* 1-5-10
* 2-11
* 3-17
* 4-12
* 6-16
* 7-13
* 8-14
* 9-15
* 18-25 (optional)

After plugging the modified connector onto the notebook, the BIOS shouldn't ask for any password.
