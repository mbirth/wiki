Install on 4.2e
===============

* Download the [bannerbomb v2](http://bannerbomb.qoid.us/index.new.php) and unzip the file to your SD-Card (make sure
  to remove ANY OTHER Wii data from the `private` directory otherwise it will NOT work!)
* Download the [HackMii Installer](http://bootmii.org/download/) and put the `boot.dol` in the root of the SD-Card
* Start the Wii, remove any disc
* select the SD-Channel (bottom left)
* insert the prepared SD-Card and wait for the *Start boot.dol?*-prompt (if it freezes, hold Power-button to reboot the
  Wii then try again)
* select *Yes*
* follow the instructions (you most probably want to install all 3 options - try to install BootMii as boot2, if it
  doesn't work, install as IOS)
